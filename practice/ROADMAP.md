# Python for AI: Step-by-Step Roadmap 🚀

Welcome to your Python learning journey! Since you are taking an AI course, this roadmap is optimized to get you from a beginner to an expert with a focus on data science and machine learning.

## 🟢 Phase 1: Foundations (1-2 Weeks)
*Master the syntax and logic of Python.*
- [ ] **Setup:** Install Python, VS Code, and learn how to run scripts.
- [ ] **Basics:** Variables, Data Types (String, Int, Float, Bool).
- [ ] **Data Structures:** Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets.
- [ ] **Control Flow:** `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for` loops, `while` loops.
- [ ] **Functions:** Defining functions, arguments, return values, and scope.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Intermediate Python (2-3 Weeks)
*Learn to write clean, modular, and reusable code.*
- [ ] **List Comprehensions:** Writing pythonic code.
- [ ] **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, Objects, Methods, Inheritance. (Essential for Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch).
- [ ] **Modules & Packages:** Using `import`, creating your own modules.
- [ ] **Virtual Environments:** Using `venv` and `pip`.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** `try`, `except`, `finally`.
- [ ] **File Handling:** Reading and writing `.txt`, `.csv`, and `.json`.

## 🟠 Phase 3: The AI Toolkit (3-5 Weeks)
*This is where the magic happens for AI.*
- [ ] **NumPy:** Arrays, Vectorization, Matrix Algebra (The foundation of Neural Networks).
- [ ] **Pandas:** DataFrames, Data Cleaning, Analysis.
- [ ] **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data Visualization.
- [ ] **Scikit-Learn:** Core Machine Learning (Regressions, Clustering, Trees).

## 🔴 Phase 4: Expert & AI Specialization (Ongoing)
*Deep dive into advanced topics.*
- [ ] **Advanced Features:** Decorators, Context Managers, Generators.
- [ ] **Concurrency:** Threading, Multiprocessing, Asyncio (Useful for data scraping/processing).
- [ ] **Deep Learning:** PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- [ ] **API Development:** FastAPI/Flask for deploying models.
